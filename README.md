# DC Dashboard

Collects electrical data from data center systems, organizes it under a
hierarchy you define, and serves live values, history and energy use.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-dc-dashboard-design.md`

Status: backend only (Phase 1A). The web UI is the next phase; until then the
API is at `http://localhost:8000/api` with interactive docs at `/api/docs`.

## Run it

Requires Docker (Docker Desktop on Windows).

Linux / WSL:

```bash
scripts/setup.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
scripts\setup.ps1
```

The first run creates `.env` with a database password and an encryption key,
then builds and starts the stack. Keep `.env`: without its key, stored source
credentials cannot be decrypted. Set `DCDASH_TIMEZONE` in `.env` (for example
`Asia/Qatar`) so that "today" starts at local midnight.

Later starts need only `docker compose up -d`.

To include the SCADA simulator (10 LV panels), add the dev profile:

```bash
scripts/setup.sh --profile dev
uv run --project backend python scripts/smoke.py
```

## Services

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| `db` | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB |
| `api` | HTTP API; never contacts a source |
| `collector` | Polls sources and runs connection tests and browses; read-only toward sources |
| `simulator` | Stand-in SCADA, dev profile only |

## Develop

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

Tests start their own TimescaleDB container, so Docker must be running.

## Add a connector

Create `backend/dcdash/connectors/<name>.py` with a `Connector` subclass
decorated with `@register`, and import it in
`backend/dcdash/connectors/__init__.py`. See `simulator.py` for a complete
example. Nothing else changes.
